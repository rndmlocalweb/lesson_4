	<h1>A Painting by <mark>Skepta</mark> Just Sold for £81,900</h1>
	<h4>Almost £22,000 over its estimate.</h4>
	<div class="text-block">
		<p class="text-one"> A painting by acclaimed British-Nigerian rapper Skepta has just sold at auction for £81,900 GBP (approximately $94,656 USD).The piece, named “Mama Goes to Market”, went to the highest bigger at Sotheby’s, having been part of the “Contemporary Curated” sale. </p>
		<p class="text-two">The piece was originally painted by Skepta in 2020, across the space of a week. But later, it was reworked when he took it to an event hosted by Givenchy in collaboration with Chito. Here, Chito was tagging any items that people had brought along, and so – the mark of the graphic artist can be seen on the walls in the painting, along with those of fellow graphic artist Slawn and the producer and DJ Goldie. Elsewhere, the piece depicts three African women — one of whom carries a child on her back. While the pre-estimate was set between £40,000-£60,000 GBP ($46,000-$69,000 USD), it eventually sold for almost £22,000 over its estimate. Although the buyer hasn’t been made known to the public, Skepta told the Financial Times that he is hopeful that either Jay-Z or Dave Chapelle would be the one to take it home.</p>
		<p class="text-three">Marking the sale, Denim Tears has teamed up with Skepta to release a collection that “re-imagines elements of the intuitive painting through garments and textiles”. The capsule includes a t-shirt depicting the painting, and hand-painted pieces including a hoodie, long sleeve tee, jeans, and a tote, and is available for pre-order now.</p>

	<h2><mark>PUMA</mark> Leaps Into the Metaverse With Its First Digital Experience</h2>
	<div class="text-block-second">
		<p>“Twenty years ago, Black Station was PUMA’s home for our most innovative designs in fashion,” said Adam Petrick, PUMA’s Chief Brand Officer. “Given the boundaries we are pushing from a product design and digital standpoint, we found it fitting to bring Black Station back as a new portal for digital exploration
			across fashion, sport performance, our heritage classics, and innovation.”</p>
		<div>
			<p class="puma-two">Beginning on September 7, the first two portals of Black Station will reveal exclusive, never-seen-before Nitro NFRNO and Nitro Fastroid sneakers that are linked to PUMA’s NFT NitroPass mint. Owners who minted a Nitropass have access to a duo of NFTs — one related to physical products and one that grants access to a customized experience linked to their chosen shoe. Once the Futuregrade shoe concludes, minters will be allowed to acquire their physical kicks by burning their product-claimed NFT. “Our team of designers took a lot of liberties when envisioning these footwear styles. We told them the sky is the limit. As a result, we were able to harness their creativity without the typical confines and limitations of our shoe production process,” said Heiko Desens, Global Creative Director and Head of Innovation. “What is just as impressive as the actual designs is the fact that we were actually able to work with development to bring these stunning designs to life.”</p>
